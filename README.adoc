This repository gathers notes which can be used to build a simple robot on wheels.

Usage of the robot is for now focused on the possible usage as mower.

But let's go step by step with stories.

As usual, learning is the key. If things in this repository work, then great; and if not, well this is good learning.

To build this Robot, we need:

* link:bom.adoc[BOM - buying few parts]
* link:3d-parts.adoc[Printing other parts]
* link:/stories/readme.adoc[Stories detailing each parts of building]

== References

* Existing mower projects (not entirely opensource)

Concept focused on GPS-RTK.

** link:https://wiki.ardumower.de/index.php?title=Ardumower_Sunray[Ardumower]. 
This project has many details, including GPS-RTK capabilities. 
Downside is that this looks very bundled, hence complex monolith while this would be preferable to be based on interchangeable modules.

No compromise full 3D-printed mower.
Too ambitious to print everything.
Costly, yet not very modular.

Interesting modular concept.
Not documented, but gives good hints on hardware links.

PDF explaining many aspects of building simple basic mower.
Kit DIY.

** link:https://www.open-electronics.org/a-robotic-lawn-mowers-powered-by-solar-energy-with-an-arduino-heart[Open Electronic model] has a store with minimal electronic board for a solar mower.
This design is the kind I'm looking for, modular enough.

Nice simple concept. But a video remains a video without much re-usability for others.

Yet another Arduino mower. This time many details.

* Locomotion specifics:
** link:https://www.instructables.com/SCREW-DRIVE-RC-TANK[Screw drive RC tank] is moving surprisingly nice.

* Vacuum Cleaner (have a lot in common with mowers)
