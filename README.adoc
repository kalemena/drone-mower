This repository gathers notes which can be used to build a simple robot on wheels.

Usage of the robot is for now focused on the possible usage as mower.

But let's go step by step with stories.

As usual, learning is the key. If things in this repository work, then great; and if not, well this is good learning.

To build this Robot, we need:

* link:bom.adoc[BOM - buying few parts]
* link:3d-parts.adoc[Printing other parts]
* Coding the rest

== Stories

* link:stories-sensors.adoc[Sensors Testing]

* link:/stories/11-RC-mower-test[Radio controlled motors (gear and cut)]

== References

* Existing mowers

This project has many details, including GPS-RTK capabilities. 
Downside is that this looks very bundled, hence complex monolith while this would be preferable to be based on interchangeable modules.
