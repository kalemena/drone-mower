= GPS-RTK

GPS-RTK is the technology that enhance the GPS with centimeter accuracy.

== Discovery

SimpleRTK2B kit from link:https://www.ardusimple.com/[ArduSimple] is used in following tests.

=== Stage 1

Accuracy can be tested hooking up smartphone using following docs:

* Connect NTRIP Caster on link:https://docs.centipede.fr/docs/centipede/3_connect_caster.html[Centipede (France)] or link:http://rtk2go.com[RTK2GO (world)] and select a caster close to your location using the map.

With a caster at about 10km, the result is surprising when looking at the map on Android app *SW Maps*.
With no doubt, location is precise at centimeter accuracy.
Standard GPS is of by 2-10 meters on the *SW Maps* application, while GPS-RTK gives somewhere under 30cm, right away.

There are few aspects to solve:

* Requires good internet access (WiFi or 4G)
* With Android app, this remains difficult to assess where we are in accuracy between 1 and 30cm
