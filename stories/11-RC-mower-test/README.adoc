= Motors gear + I2C + motor cut + RF Controller 

Here is sketch with mixing link:/stories/10-L298N-FlySky-test[previous radio story] with link:/stories/08-I2C-test[arduino master and slave through I2C]

Difference is that now we control both motors using FlySky remote.

== Wiring

* motors and L298N are wired like in link:/stories/09-L298N-Test[previous story]

* motor XD-3420 and drive as in link:/stories/02-motors-XD-3420-test[Wiring XD-3420]
